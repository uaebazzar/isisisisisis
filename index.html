    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last updated: December 2025</div>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how our app ("FunApp", "we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use the application.
        By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or require any personal information such as your name, email address,
        phone number, or contacts.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        Our app uses third-party advertising services, including Google AdMob, to display rewarded advertisements.
        These ads are optional and shown only when initiated by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as device identifiers, IP address, and ad interaction data,
        to provide and improve advertising services.
    </p>
    <p>

            https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
    </p>

    <h2>Rewarded Ads</h2>
    <p>
        The app includes rewarded advertisements. When you choose to watch a rewarded ad and complete it,
        a feature within the app is unlocked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rewards are granted only after successful ad completion and are not guaranteed without viewing the ad.
    </p>

    <h2>Clipboard Usage</h2>
    <p>
        After a rewarded advertisement is completed, the app may copy a short text value to your device clipboard
        as part of the app’s functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clipboard access happens only after a clear user action and is not collected, transmitted, or stored by us.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share personal information with third parties.
        However, advertising partners such as Google AdMob may process limited data as described above.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This app is not directed toward children under the age of 13.
        We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect user privacy.
        No sensitive personal data is stored or processed by the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us through the app listing on Google Play.
